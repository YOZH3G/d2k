 * dropped (insert_failed/drop; router 02.10 and 03.10.2026: 61 of 61
 * increments).  So the tails never go back to the kernel when a raw path
 * exists: they are re-sent byte for byte right after the head, through the
 * entry the head (or the plan) has just confirmed, and their queued copies
 * are dropped.
 *
 * owned != 0: the plan took the head as its own last emit (fate drop): the
 * head's copy is dropped as well.
 * owned == 0: the head gets head_verdict (it is the one datagram whose entry
 * may still win), the tails are re-sent when can_resend.
 * can_resend == 0 (observe mode, no raw socket): old split, tails ACCEPT.

 * If the head's own verdict fails on an unowned batch, the head is still in
 * the queue and no entry was confirmed: the tails are not re-sent ahead of it
 * but ACCEPTed (the old behaviour).  An owned head already left as the plan's

 * (the head was ready alone: SNI in the first datagram, 0-RTT, a PTO repeat
 * right behind it) carry the same unconfirmed-entry clash.  Only datagrams
 * that reached conntrack before the head's entry was confirmed can clash:
 *   - every datagram read in the same NFQUEUE receive batch as the head's
 *     release was queued before its verdict (seq match), and
 *   - a datagram read later qualifies only within D2K_UDP_FOLLOW_NS of the
 *     moment the head left (or of the plan's deferred head, at_ns).
 * Field 03.10.2026: clashing tails reached conntrack +0.04..0.2 ms after the
 * head, while the head left ~1 ms after arrival; a 0-RTT at +2.06 ms (after the
 * head's confirm) passed on its own.  5 ms covers that plus the service's own
 * latency in reading the rest of the queue, and stays far below the client's
 * next flight (server RTT 40+ ms), which therefore goes the normal ACCEPT path
 * (its entry is confirmed, its conntrack accounting and routing untouched). */
